                    Breaks Into Fullstack Development</h1>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="intro">    Hi there, I'm Jess. I'm a software tester, indie game developer,
                    and amateur AI researcher. I made this page to satisfy the webpage creation requirement for the
                    AZNext Full Stack Developer Certification.</p>
                <a class="article-paragraph flashing-asu-text" href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/aznext/programs/full-stack-developer-certification"> Click here to see more info on the Full Stack Developer Certificate</a>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="why-this">So why did I choose to make this? Honestly, partially to
                    amuse myself I as I worked. Hand coding is not my favorite thing to do but the assignment was to
                    hand code a webpage to prove basic understanding, so that is what I was going to do. However, this
                    design also serves as an excellent opportunity for me to showcase knowledge in a variety of places
                    as well as reference other things I am working on. For example, I will also use it to mention my in
                    development game, Chronicles of the Kethaneum.</p>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="what-I-want">I hope to get a few things out of this effort. My first
                    hope is that I prove I am sufficiently well versed in web technologies. But beyond that, I want to
                    take this full stack developer course to round out my programming undrestanding. I actually use AI
                    help with most of my projects but AI help is never a substitute for the human knowing their stuff.
                    So, in order to make better and better programs with my AIs, I want to improve my end of the project
                    and make sure that I know what I'm asking for and how I am directing the work. Additionally, I hope
                    that I can draw attention to my personal projects and make you smile. </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="about-chronicles">So what is Chronicles of the Kethaneum, you may have
                    asked? Or maybe you were just wondering when I will shut up... Well, I can't answer the second
                    question but I can answer the first! Chronicles of the Kethaneum is a narrative driven word search
                    game. I originally came up with the concept as a prototype for my game development bootcamp. After
                    the bootcamp, I decided that I would actually see if it was viable ot try to build the game I
                    envisioned. I was shocked by how much I was able to accomplish so fast while working with AIs </p>
