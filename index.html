                    Breaks Into Fullstack Development</h1>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="intro">Hi there, I'm Jess. I'm a software tester, indie game developer,
                    and amateur AI researcher. This page created as a requirement to prove I can hand code a webpage. It
                    was a requirement for the
                    AZNext Full Stack Developer Certification.</p>
                <a class="article-paragraph flashing-asu-text"
                    href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/aznext/programs/full-stack-developer-certification"> Click here to see
                    more info on the Full Stack Developer Certificate</a>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="why-this">So why did I choose to make this page, specificall? Honestly?
                    I made it partially to amuse myself I as I worked. Hand coding is not my favorite thing to do. But
                    the assignment was to hand code a webpage to prove basic understanding, so that is what I did.
                    However, this design also serves as an opportunity for me to showcase knowledge and reference other
                    things I'm
                    working on. For example, I will also use it to mention my in development game, Chronicles of the
                    Kethaneum.</p>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="what-I-want">I hope to get a few things out of this effort. My first
                    hope is that I prove I am sufficiently well versed in web technologies. But beyond that, I want to
                    take this full stack developer course to round out my programming undrestanding. I actually use AI
                    help with most of my projects but AI help is never a substitute for the human knowing their stuff.
                    So, in order to make better and better programs with my AIs, I want to improve my end of the project
                    and make sure that I know what I'm asking for and how I am directing the work. Additionally, I hope
                    that I can draw attention to my personal projects and make you smile. </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="about-chronicles">So what is Chronicles of the Kethaneum, you may have
                    asked? Or maybe you were just wondering when I will shut up... Well, I can't answer the second
                    question but I can answer the first! Chronicles of the Kethaneum is a narrative driven word search
                    game. I originally came up with the concept as a prototype for my game development bootcamp. It
                    tested well but ultimately wasn't choosen by the team for develoment. However, after
                    the bootcamp, I decided that I want to see if it was viable to try to build the game I
                    envisioned. I knew that my personal AI development methods were improving so this was a perfect
                    testbed for seeing just how much I could accomplish. I was shocked by how much I was able to
                    accomplish in so little time. But the most amazing part was seeing my vision unfold in way that
                    EXCEEDED the version I saw in my head. As any creative person knows, simply matching the creative
                    ision once it gets out of your thoughts is hard enough. Nonetheless, the game is coming along well
                    and soon I will transision from foundational coding work to content creation. Much lore on the way.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph" id="chronicles-lore"> However, I told you what kind of game it is, but what
                    is it about? Chronicles is about a place called the Kethaneum. This place is like a cosmic library
                    where information is stored across dimensions and realms. It lives in the liminal space between
                    dimensions and holds all the stories of the cosmos. What is fiction in one realm is fact in another.
                    However, the player will see the Kethaneum at a Crossroads, the time right before the calamity hit.
                    This game is a prelude, the introduction to the story of the Kethaneum and the first in the series.
                    It is my hope that players will be charmed by the stories they encounter at this library of the
                    cosmos and by the story of the Kethaneum
                </p>
